# flow-module PCB and Schematic

This repository contains
* Schematics for flow control module.
* PCBs which were designed.
* All files required to manufacture this PCB. 

Note that there is an error in one PCB: the ground plate for the L298P chip should be conneted to the ground plane but it is not. This was remedied by scratching tracks and hand-soldering solder-bridges.
